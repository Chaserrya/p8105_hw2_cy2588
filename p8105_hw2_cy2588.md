## problem 1

path to data:

``` r
path_to_data = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"
```

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
    read_xlsx(
        path = path_to_data,
        sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
        range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
    mutate(
        sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
        sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
    )
```

Read precipitation data for 2018 and 2017.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
    relocate(year)
precip_2017 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
    relocate(year)
```

combine precipitation datasets and convert month to a character
variable.

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(
        month = 1:12,
        month_name = month.name
    )
precip_df = 
    bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)
precip_df =
    left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The
Mr. Trash Wheel spreadsheet is largely self-explanatory, and includes
information on the dumpter number, date of collection, amount of total
litter and litter type. The dataset contains information on year, month,
and trash collected, include some specific kinds of trash. There are a
total of 344 rows in our final dataset. Additional data sheets include
month precipitation data.

In this precipitation dataset: \* The total precipitation in 2018 was
70.33 inches. \* The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster
in 2017 was 8

## problem 2

read and clear data

``` r
nyc_transit_df= 
    read.csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names()  %>% 
  select(line: entry, vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, YES = TRUE, NO = FALSE))%>% 
  mutate(vending = recode(vending, YES = TRUE, NO = FALSE))
```

This dataset contains . As trash enters the inner harbor, the trashwheel
collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The Mr. Trash Wheel
spreadsheet is largely self-explanatory, and includes information on the
dumpter number, date of collection, amount of total litter and litter
type. The dataset contains information on , include . There are a total
of 1868 rows and 19 cols in the resulting dataset.

How many distinct stations are there?

``` r
distinct_stations = nyc_transit_df  %>% 
    distinct(station_name, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  distinct(line, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

There are 35 distinct stations.

How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
ADA_comliant = filter(distinct_stations, ada == T)
```

There are 6 stations are ADA compliant.

What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance?

``` r
without_vending = filter(nyc_transit_df, vending == F)
allow = filter(without_vending, entry == T)
proportion = nrow(allow)/ nrow(without_vending)*100
```

The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance is 37.704918%
